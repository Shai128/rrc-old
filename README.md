# Reliable Predictive Inference in Time-Series Settings

An important factor to guarantee a responsible use of data-driven systems is that we should be able to communicate their uncertainty to decision makers. This can be accomplished by constructing prediction sets, which provide an intuitive measure of the limits of predictive performance.

This package contains a Python implementation of Rolling Risk Control (Rolling RC) [1] methodology for constructing distribution-free prediction sets that provably control a general risk in an online setting. 

A newer implementation of this package can be found at [rrc](https://github.com/Shai128/rrc).
