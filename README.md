# Reliable Predictive Inference in Time-Series Settings

Please refer to [rrc](https://github.com/Shai128/rrc) for a newer implementation of this package.

This package contains a Python implementation of Rolling Risk Control (Rolling RC) [1] methodology for constructing distribution-free prediction sets that provably control a general risk in an online setting.
